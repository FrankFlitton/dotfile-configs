# dotfile-configs
My dotfiles for macOS managed with [Yet Another Dotfiles Manager (YADM)](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/).

## On MacOS

Install git and yadm using brew:

```
$ brew install git yadm
```

Clone repository

```
$ yadm clone https://github.com/RobWin/dotfiles.git
```

The boostrap file should take care of the rest.

```
$ yadm bootstrap
```
